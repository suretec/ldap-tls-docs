Introduction

Up until now, we have discussed the straight forward configuration of
OpenLDAP?, with some advanced features such as the section called ?Access
Control Lists?. This does not however, deal with the fact that the network
transmissions are still in plain text. This is where Transport Layer Security
(TLS) comes in.

OpenLDAP? clients and servers are capable of using the Transport Layer Security
(TLS) framework to provide integrity and confidentiality protections in
accordance with - RFC2830; Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3):
Extension for Transport Layer Security

TLS uses X.509 certificates. All servers are required to have valid
certificates, whereas client certificates are optional. We will only be
discussing server certificates.

Tip

The DN of a server certificate must use the CN attribute to name the server,
and the CN must carry the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
Additional alias names and wildcards may be present in the subjectAltName
certificate extension. More details on server certificate names are in RFC2830.

We will discuss this more in the next sections.

Configuring

Now on to the good bit.

Generating the Certificate Authority

In order to create the relevant certificates, we need to become our own
Certificate Authority (CA). ^[1] This is necessary, so we can sign the server
certificate.

We will be using the OpenSSL ^[2] software for this, which is included with
every great Linux® distribution.

TLS is used for many types of servers, but the instructions ^[3] presented
here, are tailored for OpenLDAP?.

Note

The Common Name (CN), if the following example, MUST be the fully qualified
domain name (fqdn) of your ldap server.

First we need to generate the CA:


[ghenry@suretec ldap-docs]$ mkdir myCA



Move into that directory:


[ghenry@suretec ldap-docs]$ cd myCA



Now generate the CA: ^[4]


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ /usr/share/ssl/misc/CA.pl -newca
CA certificate filename (or enter to create)

Making CA certificate ...
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
.......................++++++
.............................++++++
writing new private key to './demoCA/private/cakey.pem'
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:GB
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Aberdeenshire
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Aberdeen
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Suretec Systems Ltd.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:ldap.suretecsystems.com
Email Address []:support@suretecsystems.com



Now, there are some things to note here.

 1. You MUST remember the password, as we will need it to sign the server
    certificate..

 2. The Common Name (CN), MUST be the fully qualified domain name (fqdn) of
    your ldap server.

Generating the Server Certificate

Now we need to generate the server certificate:


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ openssl req -new -nodes -keyout newreq.pem -out newreq.pem
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
.............++++++
........................................................++++++
writing new private key to 'newreq.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:GB
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Aberdeenshire
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Aberdeen
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Suretec Systems Ltd.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:ldap.suretecsystems.com
Email Address []:support@suretecsystems.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:



Again, there are some things to note here.

 1. You should NOT enter a password.

 2. The Common Name (CN), MUST be the fully qualified domain name (fqdn) of
    your ldap server.

Now, we sign the certificate with the new CA:


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ /usr/share/ssl/misc/CA.pl -sign
Using configuration from /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf
Enter pass phrase for ./demoCA/private/cakey.pem:
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok

                serial:00

Certificate is to be certified until Mar  6 18:22:26 2006 GMT (365 days)
Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y


1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
Signed certificate is in newcert.pem



That completes the server certificate generation.

Installing the Certificates

Now we need to copy the certificates to the right configuration directories,
rename them at the same time for convenience, change the ownership and finally
the permissions:


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ cp demoCA/cacert.pem /etc/openldap/
[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ cp newcert.pem /etc/openldap/servercrt.pem
[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ cp newreq.pem /etc/openldap/serverkey.pem
[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ chown ldap.ldap /etc/openldap/*.pem
[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ chmod 640 /etc/openldap/cacert.pem; chmod 600 /etc/openldap/serverkey.pem



Now we just need to add these locations to slapd.conf, anywhere before the
database declaration and ldap.conf:

slapd.conf


TLSCertificateFile /etc/openldap/servercrt.pem
TLSCertificateKeyFile /etc/openldap/serverkey.pem
TLSCACertificateFile /etc/openldap/cacert.pem



ldap.conf


TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/cacert.pem



That's all there is to it. Now on to the section called ?Testing?

Testing

This is the easy part. Restart the server:


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ /etc/init.d/ldap restart
Stopping slapd:                                            [  OK  ]
Checking configuration files for slapd: config file testing succeeded
Starting slapd:                                            [  OK  ]



Then, using ldapsearch, test an anonymous search with the -ZZ ^[5] option:


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=ldap,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" -H 'ldap://ldap.suretecsystems.com:389' -ZZ



Your results should be the same as before you restarted the server, for
example:


[ghenry@suretec myCA]$ ldapsearch -x -b "dc=ldap,dc=suretecsystems,dc=com" -H 'ldap://ldap.suretecsystems.com:389' -ZZ

# extended LDIF

sambaAlgorithmicRidBase: 1000
objectClass: sambaDomain
sambaNextUserRid: 67109862
sambaNextGroupRid: 67109863



If you have any problems, please read the section called ?Troubleshooting?

Troubleshooting

The most common error when configuring TLS, as I have already mentioned
numerous times, is that the Common Name (CN) you entered in the section called
?Generating the Server Certificate? is NOT the Full Qualified Domain Name
(FQDN) of your ldap server.

Other errors could be that you have a typo somewhere in your ldapsearch
command, or that your have the wrong permissions on the servercrt.pem and
cacert.pem files. They should be set with chmod 640, as per the section called
?Installing the Certificates?.

For anything else, it's best to read through your ldap logfile or join the
OpenLDAP? mailing list.


--------------

^[1] We could however, get our generated server certificate signed by proper
CAs, like Thawte and VeriSign, which you pay for, or the free ones, via CAcert

^[2] The downside to making our own CA, is that the certificate is not
automatically recognised by clients, like the commercial ones are.

^[3] For information straight from the horses mouth, please visit - http://
www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/; the main OpenSSL site.

^[4] Your CA.pl or CA.sh might not be in the same location as mine is, you can
find it by using the locate command, i.e. locate CA.pl. If the command
complains about the database being too old, run updatedb as root to update it.
